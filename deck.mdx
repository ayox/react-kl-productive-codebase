# A Productive React Codebase🚀

- JS and UI ❤️
- Black coffee and Football ☕️ + ⚽️
---

## About this Talk 

---

#### We need to write a new application 🤔

---

<h3> Our goal is to create a <strong style={styledBottomBorder}>productive</strong> codebase </h3>

---

### When do you feel Productive in your work?

- Achieving a significant amount or result.💪
- Confident in both estimating and executing. 😎
- Familiar, easy to explain to juniors developers.🤓
- Quicker to fix problems. 🚀

---

### What we didn't want to feel?

- Stressed.⛈ 
- Lost. 🧐
- Rushing in deadlines. 😬
- over-estimating. 🤥

---

## How React helped?

- Everything is a component. 
- Everything is reuseable. 

---
### Requirements

<Image src={forms} size='30%'></Image>

Forms : Dropdowns, Date pickers .. etc. 

---

### Requirements


<Image src={dataTable} size='50%'></Image>

Data Tables

---
### and many other requirements
---

### Things to reuse  

- Fetching data 
- Sorting
- Filtering 
- Mapping 


---

Example Code for React Form

---

<FormsExampleCode1/>

---

<FormsExampleCode2/>

---

<FormsExampleCode3/>

---

<FormsExampleCode4/>

---

<FormsExampleCode5/>

---

<FormsExampleCode6/>

---

### Before starting demo 

**Higher-order component (HOC)**: 

A function that takes a component and returns a new component.

**Custom Hooks**: 

Ability to re-use stateful logic between components.

---

# Demo 

---

<strong style={styledBottomBorder}>Recap</strong>

---

<FormsExampleCode7/>

---

### Question to ask yourself?

- Do you feel productive? 💪
- Are you confident when coding? 😎
- Is the codebase easy to explain to new developers?🤓
- How long it takes to fix a problem ? 🕐

---

### Don't be afraid to refactor

<span style={styledBottomBorder}>It's Worth it</span>

---
